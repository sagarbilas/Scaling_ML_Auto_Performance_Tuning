# Script to run libEnsemble using multiprocessing on launch nodes.
# Assumes Conda environment is set up.

# To be run with central job management
# - Manager and workers run on launch node.
# - Workers submit tasks to the nodes in the job available (using exe.pl)

# Name of calling script
export EXE=run_ytopt_xsbench.py

# Communication Method
export COMMS="--comms local"

# Number of workers. For multiple nodes per worker, have nworkers be a divisor of nnodes, then add 1
# e.g. for 2 nodes per worker, set nnodes = 12, nworkers = 7
export NWORKERS="--nworkers 9"  # extra worker running generator (no resources needed)
# Adjust exe.pl so workers correctly use their resources

# Name of Conda environment
export CONDA_ENV_NAME=yt

export PMI_NO_FORK=1 # Required for python kills on Theta

# Unload Theta modules that may interfere with job monitoring/kills
module load miniconda-3/latest
module unload trackdeps
module unload darshan
module unload xalt

# Activate conda environment
export PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1
conda activate $CONDA_ENV_NAME

# Launch libE
